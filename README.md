<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Rocket Elevators Information System is the 4th and 5th project for the Odyssey 14 weeks program in CodeBoxx. 

By the 4th week We have created a CRUD website using a using Ruby on Rails with the website created in the Genesis Program. 

website used: [rocketlift.ca/](https://rocketlift.ca/)

We have also included a MySql Database that saves the quotations inserted in the quote form, and an Admin page.

##

For the 5th week, we have included a Data Warehouse with Postgres where has taken the subimitted quotes and contact forms info and through some queries
the Admin was able to analyse those data.

<br>

We have 7 API on the project

- **[Maps JavaScript API]**
- **[Twillo]**
- **[Zendesk]**
- **[Sengrid]**
- **[IBM Watson]**
- **[Dropbox]**
- **[Slack]**

If you want to test Dropbox, you have to create a customer (from backoffice) and a lead (from the index page) with the same phone number and email and go on the Admin_Stats page to trigger Dropbox.

If you want to test google maps, wait for it to finish loading, even if the browser isn't loading anymore.

If you want to test watson, press on the button to load him.
